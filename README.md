Connects to a [Beszel](https://github.com/henrygd/beszel) Hub and exposes server monitoring metrics for all registered systems as ioBroker states.

---

## Features

- Fetches metrics from all systems registered in your Beszel Hub
- Per-system states: CPU, memory, disk, network, temperature, load average
- Optional: GPU metrics, Docker/Podman containers, battery, extra filesystems, CPU breakdown, systemd services
- Configurable poll interval (10–300 seconds)
- Automatic re-authentication when the token expires
- Connection test button in the admin UI
- Automatic cleanup of states for removed systems and disabled metrics

---

## Requirements

- **Node.js >= 20**
- **ioBroker js-controller >= 7.0.0**
- **ioBroker Admin >= 7.6.20**
- A running [Beszel Hub](https://github.com/henrygd/beszel) with at least one registered system

---

## Configuration

### Connection

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Beszel Hub URL** | Full URL of your Beszel Hub (e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8090`) | — |
| **Username** | Beszel Hub login email/username | — |
| **Password** | Beszel Hub password | — |
| **Poll Interval (s)** | How often to fetch data from the Hub | `60` |

Use the **Test Connection** button to verify your credentials before saving.

### Metrics

All metrics are global toggles that apply to **all** systems. Disabled metrics are automatically removed from the state tree on the next adapter start.

| Group | Metric | Default |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **System** | Uptime | on |
| | Agent Version | off |
| | Systemd Services (total / failed) | off |
| **CPU** | CPU Usage (%) | on |
| | Load Average (1m / 5m / 15m) | on |
| | CPU Breakdown (User / System / IOWait / Steal / Idle) | off |
| **Memory** | Memory Usage (% and GB) | on |
| | Memory Details (Buffers, ZFS ARC) | off |
| | Swap | off |
| **Disk** | Disk Usage (% and GB) | on |
| | Disk Read/Write Speed | on |
| | Additional Filesystems | off |
| **Network** | Network Traffic (Upload / Download MB/s) | on |
| **Temperature** | Temperature (hottest sensors avg) | on |
| | Individual Temperature Sensors | off |
| **GPU** | GPU Metrics (Usage, Memory, Power) | off |
| **Containers** | Container Monitoring (Docker / Podman) | off |
| **Battery** | Battery Status | off |

## State Tree

States are organized into channels per metric group. Optional channels (marked *) are only created when the corresponding metric is enabled.

> **Breaking change in 0.3.0:** States moved from flat paths (e.g. `cpu_usage`) to channels (e.g. `cpu.usage`). Legacy states are automatically cleaned up on first start.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection failed
- Verify the Hub URL is reachable from the ioBroker host
- Check username and password (use the Test Connection button)
- Check that no firewall blocks access to the Beszel Hub port

### States not updating
- Check the ioBroker log for errors from the `beszel` adapter
- Ensure the poll interval is not too short (minimum 10 seconds)
- Check `info.connection` state — if `false`, authentication failed

### Missing states for a system
- The system may be `down` or `paused` in Beszel — no stats records exist yet
- Verify the metric is enabled in the adapter configuration

---

## Changelog
### 0.3.5 (2026-04-26)
- Process-level `unhandledRejection` / `uncaughtException` handlers added as last-line-of-defence against fire-and-forget rejections.
- Stop shipping the `manual-review` release-script plugin — adapter-only consequence.
- Bump min js-controller to `>=7.0.23` (matches latest-repo recommendation).
- Audit-driven boilerplate sync with the other krobi adapters (`.vscode` json5 schemas, `tsconfig.test` looser test rules).
- README footer-link to `CHANGELOG_OLD.md` restored, `CHANGELOG_OLD.md` cleaned up to consistent compact style.

### 0.3.4 (2026-04-23)
- Separate test-build output (`build-test/`) from production `build/`, so `npm test` no longer risks leaving duplicated `build/src` + `build/test` trees in the published package.
- Declare `systems` folder as instance object so the parent exists before per-system devices appear.
- Wrap async `onReady` and `onMessage` with `.catch()` to prevent unhandled promise rejections from SIGKILLing the adapter.
- Drop now-redundant dynamic creation of `info` and `info.connection` in `onReady` — both are declared via `instanceObjects` and created by the adapter framework at install time.

### 0.3.3 (2026-04-19)
- Latest-repo review compliance: `common.messagebox=true` added because the `Check Connection` button in the admin UI routes through `onMessage`. Runtime behaviour unchanged.

### 0.3.2 (2026-04-18)
- API boundary hardening: every field from the Beszel Hub passes through a type-coercion layer (NaN, Infinity, missing fields, wrong types can no longer reach states)
- Records missing required identifiers (`id`, `name`) are skipped rather than written as malformed objects
- `+105` new drift tests covering primitive coercers, API response shape changes, and state-writer edge cases

### 0.3.1 (2026-04-12)
- Fix: handle response stream errors (prevents unhandled exceptions on connection drop)
- Fix: isolate per-system poll failures (one broken system no longer blocks all others)
- Fix: harden onMessage with try/catch and callback guard
- Fix: classify EHOSTUNREACH as network error for proper log deduplication

### 0.3.0 (2026-04-12)
- **Breaking:** Reorganize state tree into channels (info, cpu, memory, disk, network, temperature, battery).
- Automatic migration removes legacy flat state paths on first start.
- Fix: read-only percentage states use correct `value` role instead of `level`.
- Complete state tree documentation in README.

### 0.2.7 (2026-04-12)
- README state tree fixed (8 missing default-on states added), `no-floating-promises` lint rule added, redundant CI checkout removed.

Older entries have been moved to [CHANGELOG_OLD.md](CHANGELOG_OLD.md).
