# Older Changes
## 0.4.5 (2026-05-13)
- Adapter shuts down cleanly even if the "Test Connection" button was still running — the test request is now aborted at unload along with regular polling.

## 0.4.4 (2026-05-13)
- Debug log traces previously silent paths: HTTP request lifecycle, token authentication, pagination walks and the 429-retry. Default log unchanged.
- Test Connection in admin no longer hangs on an unknown command — it now gets a clear error response instead.

## 0.4.3 (2026-05-10)
- Big setups (200+ servers / 500+ containers) now load completely instead of being silently truncated, and they start up noticeably faster — system updates, cleanups and the startup migration run in parallel.
- New "Request timeout" setting in admin (5–120 s, default 15 s) for slow links or very large payloads.
- Hub rate-limit (429): one transparent retry that honours `Retry-After`; permanent rate-limits surface as a clear log so you can raise the poll interval.
- "Forbidden" (403) responses now show a permission hint instead of looping reauth.
- Two servers whose names sanitize to the same id no longer overwrite each other — the second gets a hash suffix and a warn so you can rename on the Hub.
- Adapter shuts down cleanly even if the Hub is slow — pending requests are aborted.

## 0.4.2 (2026-05-09)
- Adapter log messages are now English only, in line with the ioBroker community standard. Localized state names (11 languages) are unchanged.

## 0.4.1 (2026-05-07)
- Restored the blank line between the changelog footer and the Support section (release-script swallowed it in v0.4.0).

## 0.4.0 (2026-05-07)
- State names localized in 11 ioBroker languages, following the system setting.
- Object cache cuts js-controller calls per poll cycle.
- Baseline: Node 22, Admin 7.8.23 (ioBroker May-2026 stable).
